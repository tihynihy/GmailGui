------------GMAIL GUI----------

	This is my first GUI project 
 	Two frames 
	1st : Main Login frame with few functions: 
		-Login activation button
			-Checks the email and the password from the userData class ( dataBase package ) 
		
		-Registration activation button 
			-Goes to the creation of an account frame
	
	2nd: Create an account - frame 
		-Input fields for the data 
		-Actions: 
			-Reset button ( sets all fields to null )
			-Confirm button 
				-Checks similarity with the userData class ( dataBase package )
			-then goes to the 1st frame again

	
	Simple yet a fun project :)
